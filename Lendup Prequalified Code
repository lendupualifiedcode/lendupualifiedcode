Predatory lending includes any unscrupulous practices carried out by lenders to persuade borrowers to take out loans they are unable to pay back or must pay back at a cost that is extremely above the market rate. Predatory lenders take advantage of borrowers' circumstances or lack of knowledge.1

A loan shark, for instance, is the archetypal example of a predatory lenderâ€”someone who loans money at an extremely high interest rate and may even threaten violence to collect on their debts. However, a great deal of predatory lending is carried out by more established institutions like banks, finance companies, mortgage brokers, attorneys, or real estate contractors.
