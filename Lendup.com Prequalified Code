Predatory lending typically means imposing unfair, deceptive, or abusive loan terms on borrowers. In many cases, these loans carry high fees and interest rates, strip the borrower of equity, or place a creditworthy borrower in a lower credit-rated (and more expensive) loan, all to the lender's benefit.

Predatory lenders often use aggressive sales tactics and exploit borrowersâ€™ lack of understanding of financial transactions. Through deceptive or fraudulent actions and a lack of transparency, they entice, induce, and assist a borrower in taking out a loan they will not reasonably be able to pay back.
