Classic predatory lending centers around home mortgages. Because home loans are backed by a borrower’s real property, a predatory lender can profit not only from loan terms stacked in their favor but also from the sale of a foreclosed home if a borrower defaults. Subprime loans aren’t automatically predatory. Their higher interest rates, banks would argue, reflect the greater cost of riskier lending to consumers with flawed credit. But even without deceptive practices, a subprime loan is riskier for borrowers because of the tremendous financial burden it represents. With the explosive growth of subprime loans came the potential for predatory lending.

When the housing market crashed, and a foreclosure crisis precipitated the Great Recession, homeowners with subprime mortgages became vulnerable. Subprime loans came to represent a disproportionate percentage of residential foreclosures. Black and Latino/Latina homeowners were particularly affected.
